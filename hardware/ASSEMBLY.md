# Assembly Instructions

Detailed instructions coming soon.

### Steps

1. Put together Raspberry Pi & accessories, plug the camera into port 0.
2. Insert M2 screws into 4 holes in the middle of the casing. On the other side, put the camera on and secure with M2 nuts.
    - Cable/connector should point towards the side of the casing with only 1 zip/cable tie hole.
3. Put Pi into casing, insert M2.5 screws and secure with M2.5 nuts on the other side.
4. Insert 1/4-20 UNC nut into hexagon hole on tripod adapter, then mount the adapter onto the casing with M4 screws.
5. Fit the top ventilation lid over the casing.
6. Insert zip/cable ties into the 2 set of holes where the tripod adapter is. Wrap the zip/cable ties around each of the 2 legs of the tripod adapter. Pull until slightly tight.

ðŸŽ‰ Assembly is finished! The 2 zip/cable ties acts as a hinge when the tripod adapter is not screwed on, allowing the ventilation lid to be rotated open.
